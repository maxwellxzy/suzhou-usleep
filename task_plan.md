# Task Plan: Hospital Website

## Goal
Create a professional, clean hospital website using React + Vite.
Frontend only.
Use provided docs and images.
Follow `brainstorming`, `canvas-design`, `frontend-design`, `ui-ux-pro-max` skills.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Context & Requirements [in_progress]
- [ ] Analyze `docs` provided by user
- [ ] Brainstorm design and features
- [ ] Define requirements and scope

### Phase 2: Design [pending]
- [ ] Create UI/UX design plan
- [ ] Define design system (colors, typography, components)
- [ ] Sketch/Plan key pages (Landing, specific hospital sections)

### Phase 3: Setup [pending]
- [ ] Initialize React + Vite project
- [ ] Setup TailwindCSS (if agreed) or Vanilla CSS as per default rules (check user preference?) -> User said "canvas-design frontend-design ui-ux-pro-max", `frontend-design` might imply specific tools. The global rules say Vanilla CSS unless requested, but modern "professional/clean" often implies a framework. I'll stick to rules or ask.
- [ ] Setup routing structure

### Phase 4: Implementation [pending]
- [ ] Implement Shell/Layout (Header, Footer)
- [ ] Implement Landing Page
- [ ] Implement Internal Pages
- [ ] Integrate Images

### Phase 5: Verification [pending]
- [ ] Verify responsiveness
- [ ] Verify against design requirements
